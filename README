Old SAI (LPI)
=======
From this point on, SAI will  no longer support dialog, I have completely moved it so slmenu and all further development will happen here at the new repository. Feel free to fork and get it up to date if you really feel that you need a tui for something so simple that it's more efficent only to have a cli+slmenu.
