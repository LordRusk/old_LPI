# Old LPI
From this point on, dialog-LPI or old-lpi will no longer be supported, I have completely moved it so slmenu and all further development will happen there. Feel free to fork and get it up to date if you really feel that you need a tui for something so simple that it's more efficent only to have a cli+slmenu.
